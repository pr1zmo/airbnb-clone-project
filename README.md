# airbnb-clone-projectirBnB Clone Project

## Project Overview

The AirBnB Clone Project is a full-stack web application replicating the core functionalities of the AirBnB platform. The primary goal is to design and develop a scalable system that handles property listings, user interactions, bookings, and payments using modern web technologies. The project will emphasize modularity, performance, and secure API design.

**Project Goals:**
- Develop a feature-complete AirBnB clone.
- Use modern backend and frontend technologies.
- Implement secure, scalable database and API architecture.

**Tech Stack:**
- Django
- PostgreSQL
- GraphQL
- Docker
- GitHub Actions

## Team Roles

### Backend Developer
Responsible for developing server-side logic, API endpoints, and integrating with the database. Ensures functionality such as user authentication, bookings, and data validation.

### Frontend Developer
Implements the user interface using modern frameworks. Handles the user experience and communication with the backend APIs.

### Database Administrator
Designs and manages the database schema. Ensures data integrity, optimizes queries, and sets up backups and migration strategies.

### DevOps Engineer
Manages deployment pipelines, monitors infrastructure, and maintains the CI/CD setup for seamless integration and delivery.

### QA Engineer
Develops and runs test cases to ensure code quality. Performs manual and automated testing to identify and resolve issues.

## Technology Stack

- **Django:** Web framework used to build RESTful and GraphQL APIs. Handles routing, business logic, and server-side rendering.
- **PostgreSQL:** Relational database for storing user, property, booking, and payment data.
- **GraphQL:** API query language providing flexible and efficient data fetching for frontend applications.
- **Docker:** Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
- **GitHub Actions:** Automates testing, linting, and deployment tasks as part of the CI/CD pipeline.

## Database Design

### Key Entities

- **Users**
  - `id`: Unique identifier
  - `email`: User email address
  - `password_hash`: Encrypted password
  - `role`: Host or Guest
  - `created_at`: Registration timestamp

- **Properties**
  - `id`: Unique identifier
  - `owner_id`: References Users
  - `title`: Property title
  - `location`: Property address
  - `price_per_night`: Rental rate

- **Bookings**
  - `id`: Unique identifier
  - `user_id`: References Users
  - `property_id`: References Properties
  - `start_date`: Start of booking
  - `end_date`: End of booking

- **Reviews**
  - `id`: Unique identifier
  - `user_id`: Reviewer (References Users)
  - `property_id`: Reviewed property
  - `rating`: Score given
  - `comment`: Review content

- **Payments**
  - `id`: Unique identifier
  - `booking_id`: References Bookings
  - `amount`: Payment total
  - `status`: Paid or Pending
  - `timestamp`: Payment time

**Relationships:**
- One user can have multiple properties.
- One property can have many bookings and reviews.
- One booking links one user to one property.
- Each booking may have one payment.

## Feature Breakdown

### User Management
Handles user registration, login, profile updates, and role assignment (Host/Guest). Ensures secure authentication and session management.

### Property Management
Allows hosts to create, update, and delete property listings. Includes property images, descriptions, pricing, and availability.

### Booking System
Enables users to search properties, check availability, and make bookings. Prevents booking conflicts and validates dates.

### Review System
Permits users to leave feedback and ratings after stays. Helps build credibility and transparency on the platform.

### Payment Integration
Processes payments securely via third-party gateways. Links payments to bookings and tracks transaction statuses.

## API Security

### Authentication
Secures access using token-based mechanisms (e.g., JWT). Prevents unauthorized access to user data and actions.

### Authorization
Restricts actions based on roles (e.g., only hosts can list properties). Enforces permissions at the API layer.

### Rate Limiting
Prevents abuse by limiting the number of requests per user/IP. Essential to deter automated attacks.

**Importance:**
- Protects sensitive user and financial data.
- Ensures platform integrity.
- Prevents fraudulent activity and misuse.

## CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD pipelines automate code testing, integration, and deployment. Every push to the repository triggers a sequence that runs tests, checks code quality, and deploys updates to production/staging environments.

**Tools:**
- **GitHub Actions:** Automates testing and deployment workflows.
- **Docker:** Packages the application into containers for consistent builds.
- **Docker Compose:** Orchestrates multi-container environments during development and testing.
